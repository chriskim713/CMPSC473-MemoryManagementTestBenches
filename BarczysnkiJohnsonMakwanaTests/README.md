# Barczynski, Johnson, Makwana Testbenches

Testbench for project 3 by John Barczynski, Kyle Johnson, and Mayank Makwana

# Instructions
Copy the driver.cpp in place of your testbench file. Use a redirect to send the set of tests into the interface. Alternatively, you can enter tests into the console by just running the testbench. This allows for interactive testing.

This testbench includes two sample test files, as well as the results from our code. Additionally, we have provided a Python 3 script for the generation of more testbenches with different parameters. The usage is "python3 generate.py policy N numFrames virtualAddressSpaceSize outputFileName".
