Copy and paste the include the functions in testbench.cpp to your project to read my input files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The function run_test reads input from a file name and outputs to a different file.

The input files are delimited by new lines. 
The first 4 numbers is the replacement policy (0 is FIFO, 1 is LRU), page size, number of frames, and address size.
The remaining numbers are virtual addresses to be sent in as arguments for memoryAccess().

The output file is also delimited by a new line. Each number represent the physical address returned by memoryAccess().
The number of page swaps is outputted to stdout. 

For the XLL input files, it is recommended you run your program with -O2 and -O3 optimization as it may take several seconds to minutes to finish.
My results are also attached. You can run FC <your output> <my output> to see if our outputs differ on a Windows machine. 

NOTE: I'm still verifying my own output. Don't be surprised if our outputs differ!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The function generate_tests generate sample inputs, and uses your code to generate outputs.
The input and output file name is specified in the function paramaters. This can be used to create additional tests.
